Why __init__.py in every folder?
A constructor file needed everywhere.

The src directory in the provided file structure appears to be organized for an MLOps project related to vehicle insurance. Here's a brief overview of its structure based on the provided file:

components: This folder contains Python modules that implement various components of the machine learning pipeline. For example:

data_ingestion.py: Handles data ingestion tasks such as exporting data from a database, splitting it into training and testing datasets, and saving the results.
entity: This folder likely contains modules defining configuration and artifact entities used across the pipeline. For example:

config_entity.py: Defines configuration classes like DataIngestionConfig.
artifact_entity.py: Defines artifact classes like DataIngestionArtifact.
exception: Contains custom exception handling logic. For example:

MyException: A custom exception class used for error handling.
logger: Contains logging utilities. For example:

logging: A module for logging messages during pipeline execution.
data_access: Contains modules for accessing data from external sources. For example:

vehicle_insurance_data.py: Likely handles interactions with a MongoDB database to fetch or manipulate data.


- proj1_data.py : it uses the mongo_db_connection.py to establish a connection with the database and fetch the data.It returns
a pandas dataframe.
